# eToro App

A public, read-only portfolio analytics surface for eToro users (v1), built around the **eToro public API**. An existing MCP server (a wrapper over the same public API) sits alongside as an **optional sibling surface** — its concrete use case is TBD and a future ADR will document it when it crystallizes. Spec-driven via [GitHub Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit).

> **Status:** Foundation phase. Constitution and first spec are written. Stack is locked. Repo is not yet scaffolded.

## Foundation Documents

Read these in order before writing any code:

1. [`.specify/memory/constitution.md`](./.specify/memory/constitution.md) — non-negotiable principles.
2. [`specs/001-portfolio-view/spec.md`](./specs/001-portfolio-view/spec.md) — first thin spec (the surface the stack is hardened against).
3. [`docs/adr/0001-tech-stack.md`](./docs/adr/0001-tech-stack.md) — locked stack decisions and trade-offs.
4. [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md) — system topology, request flows, deployment.

## Stack at a glance

| Tier         | Choice                                                      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend     | Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript strict, Tailwind, shadcn/ui |
| Auth         | Better Auth (in `apps/web`), JWT validated by `.NET API`     |
| Backend API  | .NET 9 Minimal API, EF Core 9, Polly, Quartz.NET, Serilog    |
| MCP server   | Existing service, optional sibling surface (use case TBD)    |
| Database     | PostgreSQL 16 (Railway, vanilla)                             |
| Cache        | Redis 7 (Railway, vanilla)                                   |
| Hosting      | **Railway** (web, api, mcp, Postgres, Redis) + **Cloudflare** in front |
| CI/CD        | GitHub Actions; container images on GHCR; Railway pulls from GHCR |
| Observability| Grafana Cloud (LGTM + Faro) via OpenTelemetry + Better Stack synthetics |
| Portability  | Constitution Principle XIII: Docker-only, vanilla data tier, OTLP-only observability — Railway is a one-day swap to Render |

See ADR-0001 for full detail and alternatives considered.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 LTS + pnpm 9
- .NET 9 SDK
- Docker Desktop (required — Constitution Principle XIII mandates `docker compose up` parity locally)
- `uv` (for the `specify` CLI): `pipx install uv` or `winget install astral-sh.uv`
- Railway CLI (`npm i -g @railway/cli`) for deploys and one-off env work
- (Optional) Cloudflare account for the production CDN/edge tier
- A GitHub account with a repo created for this project

---

## Bootstrap (one-time)

The Constitution and first spec are already in place. The next steps are:

### 1. Initialize the Spec-Kit toolchain

The `specify` CLI installs Spec-Kit slash commands tailored for Claude Code (or your AI agent of choice) into this repo.

```powershell
# From the repo root:
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init --here --ai claude --force
```

This creates / updates `.specify/` with the templates that power the `/constitution`, `/specify`, `/clarify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/analyze`, `/implement` slash commands. Our existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is preserved.

> If you prefer a different agent, replace `--ai claude` with one of `copilot`, `cursor`, `gemini`, `windsurf`, etc. See the Spec-Kit docs.

### 2. Run the spec-kit phases against spec 001

In Claude Code (or your chosen agent), with this repo open:

```text
/clarify  specs/001-portfolio-view/spec.md
/plan     specs/001-portfolio-view/spec.md
/tasks    specs/001-portfolio-view/spec.md
/analyze
```

`/plan` will reference ADR-0001 and `docs/architecture.md` as the source of truth for the stack.

### 3. Scaffold the apps

After `/plan` produces a concrete plan and `/tasks` produces task breakdowns, the implementation tasks will scaffold:

- `apps/web` via `pnpm create next-app@latest apps/web --ts --tailwind --app --no-src-dir --eslint --use-pnpm`
- `apps/api` via `dotnet new web -n EtoroApp.Api -o apps/api` and `dotnet new sln && dotnet sln add apps/api`
- Better Auth, Drizzle, EF Core, OpenTelemetry SDKs, Grafana Faro Web SDK, Playwright, Vitest, xUnit

Do not scaffold ahead of `/plan`. The plan is what tells us *which* options to enable.

### 4. Wire infra

- Create the GitHub repo and push.
- Create a Railway project. Inside it, provision: `apps/web` service, `apps/api` service, `apps/mcp` service, Postgres database, Redis instance.
  - For each service, configure Railway to **build from `Dockerfile`** (not Nixpacks) and pull the runtime image from GHCR after CI publishes it.
  - Enable Railway's PR preview environments for `apps/web` and `apps/api`.
- Add a Cloudflare zone for the production domain and point it at the Railway public hostname for `apps/web`. Configure Page Rules / Cache Rules per ADR-0008 (future).
- Create a Grafana Cloud stack (free tier) — note the OTLP endpoint, username, and API token; Faro app token will be created from the same stack.
- Create a Better Stack project for synthetic monitors against `/health` on `apps/api` and `apps/mcp`, and a public status page hosted off-platform.
- Add secrets to GitHub Actions and Railway. The same env-var keys (`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `JWKS_URL`, etc.) appear locally in `.env`, in CI, and in Railway — no platform-specific names.

Future ADRs will document: ADR-0002 (auth topology), ADR-0008 (Cloudflare config in front of Railway), ADR-0009 (Railway-exit playbook).

## Spec-Kit Workflow Reminder

```
Constitution  →  Specify  →  Clarify  →  Plan  →  Tasks  →  Analyze  →  Implement
   (done)        (done¹)
```
¹ For spec 001 only. Future features start from `/specify`.

Skipping phases violates Constitution Principle I.

## Contributing

- Conventional Commits.
- Branch naming: `feat/{spec-id}-{slug}`, `fix/{slug}`, `chore/{slug}`.
- Every PR links the spec it implements (or the ADR it amends).
- CI must be green before merge.

## License

TBD — to be decided before public release.
